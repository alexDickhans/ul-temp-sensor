## 🔋 Power Management System

### Adaptive Tiers
| Tier | Battery Range | Wake Interval | BLE Rate | Description |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Normal | 4.2V - 3.8V | 5 minutes | 1 Hz | Full performance |
| Conserve | 3.8V - 3.6V | 15 minutes | 0.2 Hz | Reduced frequency |
| Reserve | 3.6V - 3.4V | 30 minutes | 0.1 Hz | Minimal operation |
| Survival | 3.4V - 3.2V | 60 minutes | 0.1 Hz | Critical battery |

### Hysteresis Logic
- Prevents tier flapping near threshold boundaries
- Different thresholds for ascending/descending transitions
- Stable operation in varying environmental conditions

    uint16_t battery_mv;       // Battery voltage in mV
    int16_t temperature;       // Temperature * 100 (°C)
    uint16_t pressure;         // Pressure * 10 (hPa)
    uint16_t humidity;         // Humidity * 100 (%)
    uint32_t timestamp;        // Unix timestamp
};
```

### Database Schema
